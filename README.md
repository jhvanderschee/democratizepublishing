## Democratize Publishing

### What if this was a website:

- index.html
- style.css

### What if this was a page:

&lt;section id="home"&gt;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h2&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;/section&gt;

### What if it looked like this:

<a href="https://jhvanderschee.github.io/democratizepublishing/matt-mullenweg/"><img src="https://jhvanderschee.github.io/democratizepublishing/matt-mullenweg/images/screenshot.png" style="width: 200px;" /></a>

### What if it was not only simple but also free to host?

A website built with this project has no databases, no PHP, no React, no backups, no updates and no complicated hosting environments. You can run it on your local machine by double clicking the index.html. It is not only open-source, but you can also manage it yourself. The only thing it requires is basic knowledge of HTML, which you can easily learn online.

## A shared vision

'Democratize publishing' has been the vision for WordPress for years. Matt Mullenweg described it in 2018:

> [...] the mission of “Democratize Publishing” to me means that people of all backgrounds, interests, and abilities should be able to access Free-as-in-speech software that empowers them to express themselves on the open web and to own their content.

WordPress has been very succesful, allowing millions of people to easily create websites. A wonderful achievement. This project aims to do the same, but in a completely different way. 

&nbsp;

## How it works

This project allows you to create or adjust a website that consists of one HTML and one CSS file. It uses the #anchor suffix and the :target CSS selector to show and hide pages/content. I got inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/cadars/john-doe) by [Adam Newbold](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neatnik/).

## Example websites

Below you find ready to use templates. Just adjust the HTML and make it yours.

## Add-ons

But what if you want more sophisticated elements (besides simple &lt;p&gt; tags), like a carousel, a grid layout with images or a lightbox? No problem! That is where the [add-ons](add-ons/) come in.
