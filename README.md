# Democratize Publishing

## What if?

What if knowing &lt;b&gt;this&lt;/b&gt; much HTML was enough to create, manage and host a website yourself? What if that website was not only good looking, but also so simple, that it would be free to host?

## A shared vision

'Democratize publishing' has been the vision for WordPress for years. Matt Mullenweg described it in 2018:

> [...] the mission of “Democratize Publishing” to me means that people of all backgrounds, interests, and abilities should be able to access Free-as-in-speech software that empowers them to express themselves on the open web and to own their content.

WordPress has been very succesful, allowing millions of people to easily create websites. A wonderful achievement. This project aims to take that one step further. A website built with this project has no databases, no PHP, no React, no backups, no updates and no complicated hosting environments. It is free to host (on Github for example), thus within reach for everybody. The only thing it requires is basic knowledge of HTML, which you can easily learn online. It is IMHO the ultimate 'democratization' of publishing.

## How it works

This project allows you to create or adjust a website that consists of one HTML and one CSS file. It uses the #anchor suffix and the :target CSS selector to show and hide pages/content. I got inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/cadars/john-doe) by [Adam Newbold](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neatnik/).

## Add-ons

But what if you want more sophisticated elemnts (besides simple &lt;p&gt; tags), like a carousel, a grid layout with images or a lightbox? No problem! That is where the [add-ons](add-ons/) come in.
