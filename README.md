# democratizepublishing

Matt Mullenweg said in 2018:

> [...] the mission of “Democratize Publishing” to me means that people of all backgrounds, interests, and abilities should be able to access Free-as-in-speech software that empowers them to express themselves on the open web and to own their content.

However, when my WordPress gives me all kinds of errors or is hacked and is holding my content hostage, if do not feel free nor enabled.
