# Democratize publishing

Matt Mulderberg said in 2018:

Matt did an awesome job and WordPress truly made a difference by powering millions of websites and enabling anyone to create a website. With this project I want to explore this concept further. I think that ANYONE should be able to learn the basics of HTML. This knowledge should allow you to FULLY create, manage and host a website YOURSELF. No databases, no PHP, no React, no backups, no complicated hosting environments... just HTML.

## How it works

You can create a website that consists of a single HTML and a single CSS file. Yet, you still get a multi-page website. Curious how that works? Look at the examples below.

## Example websites

- [Matt Mulderberg homepage](matt-Mulderberg/) ([demo](https://jhvanderschee.github.io/democratizepublishing/matt-Mulderberg/))

## Add-ons

What if you want a carousel, a grid layout with images or a lightbox? No problem! That is where the add-ons come in.
