### What if this was a website?

- index.html
- style.css

### What if this was a page?

&lt;section id="home"&gt;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h2&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;/section&gt;

### What if it looked like this?

### What if it was not only simple but also free to host?

A website built with this project has no databases, no PHP, no React, no backups, no updates and no complicated hosting environments. You can run it on your local machine by double clicking the index.html. The only thing it requires is basic knowledge of HTML, which you can easily learn online.
