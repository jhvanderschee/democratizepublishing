# Democratize Publishing

## What if?

What if knowing &lt;p&gt;this&lt;/p&gt; much HTML was enough to create, manage and host a website yourself? What if that website was not only good looking, but also so simple, that it would be free to host? It would 'democratize publishing' for the web.

## A shared vision

'Democratize publishing' has been the vision for WordPress for years. Matt Mullenweg described it in 2018:

> [...] the mission of “Democratize Publishing” to me means that people of all backgrounds, interests, and abilities should be able to access Free-as-in-speech software that empowers them to express themselves on the open web and to own their content.

WordPress has been very succesful, allowing millions of people to easily create websites. A wonderful achievement. This project aims to take that one step further. Imagine a website with no databases, no PHP, no React, no backups, no updates and no complicated hosting environments. Imagine a website so simple, that it is free to host (on Github for example). Would that not be the ultimate 'democratization' of publishing!?

## How it works

This project allows you to create a website that consists of one HTML and one CSS file. It uses the #anchor suffix and the :target CSS selector to show and hide pages/content. I got inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/cadars/john-doe) by [Adam Newbold](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neatnik/). What such a project looks like? Check out the examples below.

## Add-ons

But what if you want more sophisticated elemnts (besides simple &lt;p&gt; tags), like a carousel, a grid layout with images or a lightbox? No problem! That is where the [add-ons](add-ons/) come in.
