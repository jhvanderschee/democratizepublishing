# Democratize publishing

Matt Mullenweg said in 2018:

> [...] the mission of “Democratize Publishing” to me means that people of all backgrounds, interests, and abilities should be able to access Free-as-in-speech software that empowers them to express themselves on the open web and to own their content.

Matt did an awesome job and WordPress truly made a difference by powering millions of websites and enabling anyone to create a website. There is another way of democratizing publishing, which is by using HTML techniques that were popular during the 90's: plain HTML and plain CSS. 

## How it works

All you need is a single HTML and a single CSS file. You can find examples in this repo.

## Themes

- Minimal layout
- Matt Mullenweg homepage
